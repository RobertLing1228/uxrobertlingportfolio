This case study was dedicated to study about cryptocurrencies. Discover how crypto works at the same time making a case study on it. Starting from learning to trading crypto, I will document the obstacles I face in this case study.

## About CoinGecko

[CoinGecko.com](http://CoinGecko.com) is a cryptocurrency ranking site founded in 2014, that has more than 8,000,000 organic monthly traffic in Malaysia. It offers real-time and historical data on cryptocurrencies, including price charts, market capitalization, trading volume, and more. The platform covers the DeFi and NFT sectors, provides market information, and offers mobile apps. CoinGecko's utility token, CGT, is used for various purposes.

## Context

CoinGecko is a website that relies heavily on data. With the rapid growth of both CoinGecko and the crypto industry, the current design of the website is no longer adequate for the present day. This case study will focus on the improvements that need to be made to the website for it to remain relevant. The issues will be outlined, followed by a proposed solution, and an overall approach to resolve the issues will be presented.

## Outcome

There are 4 outlined issues with solutions to each of them. My solution may not be the best, but worth a discussion on improving them.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Issue 1 - Trending links

---

## Context

From the existing solution, the trending links were displayed together with tabs. Users can learn the links provided were trending topics with some experience/time with the site. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea, it‚Äôs just what evidence was based on, to put as a suggestion to my attention. Plus, the trending links were not static. It will change according to the algorithm.

My suggested solution is to separate them from tabs and suggest them to users based on clicks per hour.

## Solution(s)

The solution I pitch here is to add a type of indicator whether it‚Äôs the number of clicks, searches, or even shares from the system that catch. Show the numbers to users to gain their trust as it‚Äôs a trending topic.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Issue 2 - Search feature

---

## Context

CoinGecko has been built on a powerful collection of databases. The search function plays a crucial role in helping users find what they need. However, the current approach to the search needs to fulfill its potential. Given that CoinGecko is growing rapidly, it is essential to develop a robust search engine that can meet the users' demands.

## Solution(s)

In this case study, I suggest 3 features need to be added to the search results.

1. Recent searches - A collection of recent searches from users (Only collect product links).
2. A quick add to watchlist button - instantly add a searched item to the watchlist.
3. A 360 search about the keywords - A collection of relevant data from CoinGecko.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Issue 3 - Portfolio

---

## Context

The portfolio‚Äôs presentation was ambiguous and was not presented in detail. The user was able to read roughly what he earned from the trade and a basic total amount for the portfolio. Not good enough in this current era, where this feature was promoted as CoinGecko‚Äôs product.

## Issue Breakdown 3.1 - Transfer In/Out

In my opinion, transferring funds in and out of my account should not be categorized as profit and loss. When I transfer funds into my portfolio, this amount should not be considered as profit earned from investing in the crypto market.

_I am not a professional accountant, and this is only my perspective. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on this matter._

![3.1.png](/coingecko/3.1.png)

### Solution: Separate it from ‚ÄùProfit & Loss‚Äù. Add into ‚ÄúProceeds‚Äù

![3.1 seperate from P&L to proceeds.png](/coingecko/3.1_seperate_from_PL_to_proceeds.png)

## Issue Breakdown 3.2 - Tedious to add a new coin transaction

When we look for new crypto coins, we first research them. Users normally start with searching and land on the product page. In the existing solution, the users need to add the coin to the watchlist first and then add a transaction to the coin on the portfolio page. It wasn‚Äôt the elegant solution but it got the work done.

### Solution: Shorten the process

On the product/item page, an ‚Äúadd a transaction‚Äù button was added beside the ‚ÄúAdd to Watchlist‚Äù.

## Issue Breakdown 3.3 - Total Profit & Loss

This issue was significant to users who trade cryptocurrencies. As I research more on this topic, there are plenty of better crypto portfolio tracking apps on the market. But I still suggest enhancing to portfolio product as it was promoted on CoinGecko‚Äôs site.

Different types of users have different uses for crypto portfolios and fulfilling different aspects of a good portfolio into one(CoinGecko) is hard. I give a few examples to enrich my point here.

![3.3 type of use for portfolio.png](/coingecko/3.3_type_of_use_for_portfolio.png)

### Solution: inclusive design - Crypto trader first
üí° In this case study, 
I will use an inclusive design approach for this case study FIRST. I not trying to meet every user‚Äôs expectations toward the portfolio. To meet the ultimate expectation, I need more data from usability tests with a decent amount of users.

So, I decided that Crypto Trader is the main user of my case study‚Äôs solution, who actively trades SPOT or futures on crypto brokers/exchanges like [gate.io](http://gate.io), [binance.com](http://binance.com), etc‚Ä¶

My solution is not the best, it‚Äôs just a very niche approach to solving this issue. In this case study, I will stick with it. Here I played a trader persona, to simulate what is my user journey.

![User Journey + emotion.png](/coingecko/User_Journey_+_emotion.png)

Whereas I find the site‚Äôs weaknesses that need to be improved are

- Frustration with adding new coin and new transaction key in.
- An overview of my trade taken during the week.

### Solution: Add an overview page for total profit & loss

Adding a new overview page about total profit & loss is necessary.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Issue 4 - Price Alert

---

## Context

In the existing solution, Price Alert was disabled and prompted the user to download the CoinGecko mobile app. According to [neilpatel.com/website-traffic-checker/](https://app.neilpatel.com/en/traffic_analyzer/overview?domain=coingecko.com), CoinGecko has more than 8,000,000 organic monthly traffic, which is unacceptable to have this issue. This issue needed to be highlighted and overcome.

üí° CoinGecko is a data-intensive website. 
A normal user will start their research on their desktop and set up price alerts for the go.

When on the go, here mobile app plays the role of alerting the user. In the desired solution, UX‚Äôs Continuity Experience was fulfilled. Where the price alert was working seamlessly between the website and mobile app.

## Storyboard

![price_alert_coingecko_1.png](/coingecko/price_alert_coingecko_1.png)

## Solution

I studied Tradingview for the alert setup process. Tradingview in my opinion has the best alert system. I combined CoinGecko‚Äôs existing alert condition on the mobile app with my studies.

![4 combination tradingview and coingecko.png](/coingecko/4_combination_tradingview_and_coingecko.png)

Assuming the system can create multiple alerts and monitor them at the same time. The system needs a screen to manage the alerts. I included the screen below.

# üí´ What I learned from this

---

The case study on CoinGecko was quite engaging and informative. It helped me get a better grasp of what cryptocurrency is and how CoinGecko operates as a crypto ranking site. Regardless of UI design or UX research skills, I still have a long way to go, there are quite a lot of areas I can improve after studying different UIUX portfolios from other designers.

## Things I could do better

---

- A deep competitor audit could be helpful.
- Searching for a Figma plugin that assist me in completing this case study first, before trying to replicate the site, for example, copying HTML into the design. I don‚Äôt have to waste a few days to get my design right.
- For the usability testing data, I am the only participant. The designer's bias heavily influences the case study. To improve the case study, more people need to take the usability test.
